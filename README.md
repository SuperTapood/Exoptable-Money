# Exoptable-Money

PROJECT IS NOW IN ALPHA! 

# ROADMAP:

## Create Physics Engine
A basic engine that will include the money machine, the physics (thingys go bouncy), 
and dollars incl save and load buttons\


## Add Purchasing System
A menu that will allow to upgrade the different types of the moneys (and one that will be built dynamically to allow more types to be added)


## Add Placeholders for the letters
A letter placeholder will appear every time a letter should appear


## Add Coins


## Add Gems


## Add Cat Fur


## Add Organs


## Add Barriers for the moneys
New ways to get money will be unlocked via progress rather then being unlocked from the beginning (kind of cash cap)


## Add Madam Sinclair's Letters


## Add Doctor MoneyBags' Letters


## Seperate the game to Story Mode and Sandbox Mode
Just a simple update to include an infinite mode to the game (for some reason)


## COMPILE AND LAUNCH
slight optimizations (mainly __slots__), removing uncesseray code and some bug fixes
