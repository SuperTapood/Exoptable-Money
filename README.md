A menu that will allow to upgrade the different types of the moneys (and one that will be built dynamically to allow more types to be added)

A letter placeholder will appear every time a letter should appear


## Add coins


## Add Gems


## Add Cat Fur


## Add Organs


## Add Barriers for the moneys
New ways to get money will be unlocked via progress rather then being unlocked from the beginning (kind of cash cap)

## Seperate the game to Story Mode and Sandbox Mode
Just a simple update to include an infinite mode to the game (for some reason)
