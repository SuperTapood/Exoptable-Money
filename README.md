# Exoptable-Money

PROJECT IS NOW IN ALPHA! 


TODO:
- add credits
- animate cat
- draw buy button placeholder
- program buy button placeholder
- animate and program in the cat
- add all of the sprites for the letters (text and letter placeholder)
- add in the different letters and letter thresholds
- draw gems
- add gems to the game
- draw new buttons
- add the new buttons to the game
- draw endgame items
- add endgame items to the game
- add slots to the game classes (a bit of memory optimization)
- use location tracking instead of individual blitting? (the game will draw the same object numerous times on screen instead of different objects blitting themselves)
- add full screen function (will require all game assets to be re-read and resized to fit better and a complete overhaul of the current sprite managin system to use the current screen size as a factor for read image resizing)
